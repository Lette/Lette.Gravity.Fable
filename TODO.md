### Lette.Gravity.Fable - To do

_(not in any specific order)_

- [ ] Make canvas stretch to window size
- [ ] Use alpha channel to make objects blend nicer (and use a more interesting/nice color)
- [ ] Visualize field strength
- [ ] Make it possible to switch how objects behave at canvas' edges (pass-through, bounce, semi-stop, full-stop)
- [ ] Randomize number, position and initial velocity of objects
- [ ] Make `G` (the gravitational constant) user modifiable
- [ ] Make all initial conditions user modifiable
